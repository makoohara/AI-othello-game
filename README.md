# AI-Othello Game

This project is an implementation of the classic Othello (also known as Reversi) board game, where you can play against an AI opponent. The game is implemented in Python and designed to be run within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play Othello against a computer AI within a Jupyter Notebook.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI uses a Minimax algorithm with optional alpha-beta pruning to provide a challenging gameplay experience.
- **Visualization**: The game board is visualized using Python's `matplotlib`, allowing for a clear and interactive representation of the game state.
- **Customizable AI Difficulty**: Adjust the depth of the AI's decision-making process to increase or decrease difficulty.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Othello.git
   cd AI-Othello
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:

   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `AI-Othello.ipynb` file.

4. **Play the Game**:

   - Run the cells in the notebook to initialize the game.
   - The game will display the board, and you can make your moves by selecting the appropriate cells.
   - The AI will respond with its move after you make yours.

### Game Rules

- Othello is played on an 8x8 board with two players: one with black discs and the other with white discs.
- The goal is to have the majority of your color discs on the board at the end of the game.
- Players take turns placing a disc on the board. A move must outflank one or more of the opponent's discs, and the outflanked discs are flipped to the player's color.
- The game ends when neither player can make a valid move.

### Customization

- **AI Difficulty**: The AI's difficulty can be adjusted by changing the depth of the Minimax algorithm. Increase the depth for a more challenging opponent or decrease it for an easier game.

### Project Structure

- `AI-Othello.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the game code and interface.
- `othello.py`: (Optional) A Python script that encapsulates the game logic, used within the notebook.

### Future Improvements

- Implement additional AI strategies, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Allow multiplayer mode for two human players.
